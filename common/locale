# These are the preferred locale settings for pseudo-users
# though regular users may use them too. Generally the
# POSIX/C locale is preferred as the lowest common denominator
# for a global organization.

# Among other things this tends to keep GNU toolchains
# from using so-called "smart" (non-ascii) quotes which
# can cause all sorts of trouble. LC_ALL is the highest
# precedence locale var and should "win" over all others.
export LC_ALL=C

# This is a local requirement. Without it bash handles character class
# ranges like [A-Z] "wrongly" (or suprisingly anyway) under the default
# locale en_US.UTF-8.  Specifically, underscores sort differently
# in en_US.UTF-8. The LC_ALL setting tends to make this redundant
# but LC_COLLATE still documents the preference.
export LC_COLLATE=C

# GNU ls has a difference in -l format without this.
export LC_TIME=C

# Overridden by LC_ALL but set anyway to avoid confusion
# with the RHEL default.
export LANG=C
