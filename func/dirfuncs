#!/bin/bash (just so 'file' says the right thing)

# Written by David Boyce ~1995 and placed in the public domain.

# Minor enhancements to bash's builtin pushd/popd/dirs implementation
# including the following added features:
#
# 1. This version allows you to access the first stacked directory using
#    $lwd ("last working directory") as a shorthand for ${DIRSTACK[1]}.
# 2. It allows you to say "pushd <filename>" which will pushd to
#    "$(dirname <filename>)".
# 3. It will not push a dir to the stack that's already in the stack.
#    Pushing to a dir already on the stack just moves it to the top.
